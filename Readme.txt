here i have used the intelij for working with this assignment, and i have used 2 extra library javax.mail.jar and jbcrypt-04.jar, for working with the emails.

so inorder to run this program user need to use this 2 library.

Program instruction-
* first user need to log in as a root for add user
* when the user will log in as a root and put root as a username then he will get a password from the system.
* user need to use that password for the root for unlock the all the feature -like add user,modify user and so on.

then for testing the client , user need to logout from the admin user and then he need to log in back as a client using the username, password and the MFA for exploring the feature of client
